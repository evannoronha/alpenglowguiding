			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<Image
				class="bio-image"
				src={bioImage}
				alt="Tom Skoog holding a pair of skis in the mountains"
			/>
			<p>
				My name is Tom Skoog. I'm a lifelong Seattleite who has spent
				much of my life skiing and climbing throughout the Cascade
				Range. Growing up, I was incredibly fortunate to benefit from
				quality mentorship in the outdoors--an experience I believe
				everyone deserves access to.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				To me, climbing is an art--a unique blend of place, people, and
				our individual interpretations of adventure. Each climber brings
				their own perspective, creating something entirely their own. At
				the same time, the skills required for climbing are more like a
				craft. With the right guidance and consistent, mindful practice,
				anyone can master them.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				That's where I come in. My goal is to help you build a
				rock-solid foundation of climbing skills so you can confidently
				create your own adventure. Let's get started!
